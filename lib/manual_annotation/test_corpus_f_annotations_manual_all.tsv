This includes an observation of “no birds” when no birds were seen or heard at a sample point visit. The numbers are assigned sequentially to each observation as they are added to the Birds database (Access) for the Silvicultural Systems Trial (maintained by Forestry Tasmania). dimensionless		
urn:node:TERN NA	www.supersites.net.au/knb/metacat/lloyd.502.10/html	2	2			ecso:sample_id	oboe-characteristics:Identifier				Samplecode  A unique number assigned to each visit to a sample point. Multiple records (Recno) with the same Samplecode occur when more than one bird species are detected in a visit. Each Samplecode is prefixed with the respective alphanumeric code of the treatment within the Silvicultural Systems Trial: All sample points along Bird Track are assigned the prefix “EX”.		
urn:node:TERN NA	www.supersites.net.au/knb/metacat/lloyd.502.10/html	2	3			ecso:sampling_site	oboe-characteristics:Identifier				Pointcode  A code assigned to each unique sample point.

The time of the midpoint of the sample is used to designate the sample as day or night. Its important because the CPR sample is at a fixed depth, but some zooplankton migrate upwards at night, therefore some taxa are only sampled at night. For some statistics you will need to know the proportion of day versus night samples in a particular region and time frame.

Zooplankton counts are recorded for all species and specimen types in each sample. CPR sample analysis is reported for two zooplankton stages: "eyecount" and "traverse". "Eyecount"= zooplankton larger than 2mm; whole sample is checked by eye for presence of species, which are then removed from the sample to be identified under the microscope. "Traverse"= zooplankton smaller than 2mm; sub sample under lower magnification; traverse of the sample is made by microscope, and all individuals are counted.

Sometimes an organism is too rare to be counted in its correct analysis stage but is seen in a subsequent analysis stage. It is recorded as "present" to show that it was there, but not abundant enough to be counted. For full definitions see the Table fo Accepted Values for phytoplankton (_p) and zooplankton (_z).

These radii are referred to as buffer.shp themes for each resource theme in the ArcView product.

Whereas in 1990 and 1991 only the dominant habitat was surveyed. The "Habitat ID" has two characters: The 1st denotes habitat type, D for dominant habitats and S for subhabitats; the 2nd character denotes habitat number. Thus D1 denotes first dominant habitat, and S3 denotes the third subhabitat.

Titer testing employs serial dilution to obtain approximate quantitative information from an analytical procedure that inherently only evaluates as positive or negative. The titer corresponds to the highest dilution factor that still yields a positive reading. For example, positive readings in the first 8 serial twofold dilutions translate into a titer of 1:256 (i.e., 2−8). Titers are sometimes expressed by the denominator only, for example 1:256 is written 256.

A fatty acid is a carboxylic acid with a long aliphatic (carbon chain) tail which is either saturated (no double bonds between carbon pairs) or unsaturated (at least one double bond between carbon pairs). In the naming of fatty acids, lipid numbers take the form C:D, where C is the number of carbon atoms in the fatty acid chain and D is the number of double bonds in the fatty acid (if more than one, the double bonds are assumed to be interrupted by CH2 units, i.e., at intervals of 3 carbon atoms along the chain). This notation can be ambiguous, as some different fatty acids can have the same numbers. n−x nomenclature both provides names for individual compounds and classifies them by their likely biosynthetic properties in animals. A double bond is located on the xth carbon–carbon bond, counting from the terminal methyl carbon (designated as n toward the carbonyl carbon. For example: linolenic acid is written as 18:2 n-6, this means that there are 18 carbons in the fatty acid chain and there are 2 double bonds, with the first double bond occurring 6 carbons from the methyl end (between carbons 6 and 7) and the second would be at the 9th carbon (between carbons 9 and 10).  Here is a drawing of the chemical structure for linolenic acid (18:2 n-6) CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH. i and ai stands for iso and anteiso, which are branched chain fatty acids, me stands for fatty acids that contain a methyl group, d stands for deoxy, and represents fatty acids with less oxygen atoms than normal.
