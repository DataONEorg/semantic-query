Assemble spreadhseet for holding manual annotations

Goal is to annotate all attributes, all datasets in corpus E.
Total in "annotator_spreadsheet_template.txt" is 17589, which is too many to do all in one pass, so set 
priorities.

Priority 1: datasets matching test queries + carbon cyclying datasets that do not match any query.
Priority 2: attributes that have classes available in ECSO
Priority 3: TBD
some attributes are not likely to be annotated



overall:
select datassets from the corpus E ground truth spreadsheet. match selected datasets with the template having all corpus E attributes to the priority datasets.

Prep:
1. select datasets for current grouping (priority) in google spreadsheet

Assemble input files:
A. the annotation template with all attributes listed
2. have a copy of ben's template (annotator_spreadsheet_template.txt)
3.add empty column to front of each row of template (so you can match on col2)

<code> 
 sed 's/^/NA\t/' annotator_spreadsheet_template.txt > annotator_spreadsheet_template_for_awkmatch.txt 
</code>

selected datasets, with priority
4. export spreadsheet as TAB sep
5. cut to usable size for merge, filter rows with current priority
adjust the grep pipe for other priorities, eg a '2' at the end of the line indicates priority 2. create other lists for later groups of datasets

<code>
  cut  -f1-13 ground_truth_test_corpus_E\ -\ FINAL.tsv  | grep 1$ | cut -f 1,2 > node_id_priority1.tsv
</code>



6. match  

<code>
 awk 'NR==FNR { h[$2] = $1 ; next} {print h[$2],$0}' node_id_priority1.tsv annotator_spreadsheet_template_for_awkmatch.txt |  grep -v '^ NA' > matched_template_priority1.tsv 
</code>


7. upload to online spreadsheet, annotate.
[ shared doc in the sem-discovery google drive folder ]

8. when annotated, export, trim as needed, commit



8. Commit to git:
these instructions
original template from Ben (from step 2)
template for match (with extra col, from step 3)
list for spec'd priority (step 4)
annotation template (step 6)
annotations (step 7)
