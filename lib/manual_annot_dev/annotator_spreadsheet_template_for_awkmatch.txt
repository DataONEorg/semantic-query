This includes an observation of “no birds” when no birds were seen or heard at a sample point visit. The numbers are assigned sequentially to each observation as they are added to the Birds database (Access) for the Silvicultural Systems Trial (maintained by Forestry Tasmania). dimensionless	
NA	www.supersites.net.au/knb/metacat/lloyd.502.10/html	2	2	Samplecode  A unique number assigned to each visit to a sample point. Multiple records (Recno) with the same Samplecode occur when more than one bird species are detected in a visit. Each Samplecode is prefixed with the respective alphanumeric code of the treatment within the Silvicultural Systems Trial: All sample points along Bird Track are assigned the prefix “EX”. 	
NA	www.supersites.net.au/knb/metacat/lloyd.502.10/html	2	3	Pointcode  A code assigned to each unique sample point. The twenty sample points monitored annually along Bird Track are assigned Pointcodes in the range EX01 – EX021 (sample point EX019 is excluded).
